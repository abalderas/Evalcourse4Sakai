Abstract: Students’ acquisition of generic skills is a key to their incorporation into the job world. However, teachers encounter several difficulties when measuring their students’ performance in generic skills. These difficulties increase in online courses based on learning management systems, where there is no direct contact between teachers and their students. To address this problem, this paper adopts a solution based on the use of activity records from learning management systems as indicators of the students’ performance in generic skills. After conducting a survey among teachers of online courses on the suitability of the solution, an artefact was developed and applied within four online courses. Interviews conducted with teachers and the results of a survey for mapping skills and activities provide positive evidence of this solution’s potential.
